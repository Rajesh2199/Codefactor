As a part of code refactor project HTML and CSS code for a website for a marketing agency has been improved and optimized. No significant changes in code were made however a minor tweaks in sequence of codes in HTML and CSS sheet have been slightly altered to make overall code less wordy and more organized. Below are the changes that were made in the code. -In style.css sheet, deleting code .header div ul { list-style-type:none} did not change the appearance and functionality of the page. Hence, this specific line of code was declared redundant and removed from the sheet to make the codes look less wordy.

-In Style.css sheet, code(lines74-78) .content{ width:75%;display:inline-block;margin-left:20px;} was cut and pasted after .hero{} to Make sure they fall in sequential order and with HTML elements.

-Codes in line 134-186( all the CSS elements for search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing) were cut and pasted after line 74 to follow the sequential order of HTML elements.

In Style.css sheet, color for benefits class was changed to # 0072bb from #2589bd,to match with .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management and .social-media-marketing classes.
-In Style.css sheet, padding for .benefits class was also increased to 50px from 20px. This was done to make sure it matches with the padding of the rest of the three classes.
